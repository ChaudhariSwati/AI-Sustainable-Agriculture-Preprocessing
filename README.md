# AI for Sustainable Agriculture — Crop Recommendation using ML

This project uses AI/ML techniques to help farmers by recommending suitable crops based on soil and climate conditions.  
In this phase (30% of the project), we focus on **data preprocessing**, which includes:  

- Loading the dataset  
- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Normalizing numerical features  
- Saving the clean dataset for future modeling  

### Dataset Source
The dataset is from Kaggle: [Crop Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset)

### Progress
- [x] Data Preprocessing ✅  
- [ ] Model Training  
- [ ] Model Evaluation  
- [ ] Prototype Building  

### How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/preprocess.py
